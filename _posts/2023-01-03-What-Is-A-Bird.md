<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>What is a bird?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A bird is a song,</p>
<p>Written in the sky,</p>
<p>Written for the sky,</p>
<p>Each wing flap a note,</p>
<p>Each flight a melody,</p>
<p>Caged at night as a poem,</p>
<p>To be sung again tomorrow.</p>
<p></p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>What is a song?</p>

<p>A song is a bird,</p>
<p>Set free by a voice,</p> 
<p>Set free by your voice,</p>
<p>It soars into my ears,</p>
<p>It pecks at my fears,</p> 
<p>I will cage it in my heart,</p>
<p>Only to set it free tomorrow.</p>
</div>
